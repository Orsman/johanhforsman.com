    <h1>Workout</h1>

    <p>Comming up…
<!--
My philosophy around physical training is pretty simple. Just do whatever you like, and do it hard.
I started working when I was around 10. All my closest friends played sports. I didn’t. But hated being the worst in the field when we played sports after school. So I started running. If I would have got fitness I would be able to out last, the lazy ones and be valueable to my team. This were in the days before you could google <em>"how to improve fitness"</em>, so I had no idea how to workout to get good fitness so I just ran a couple times a week. Often very short.
After a couple of years of just running and some occasional pushups/situps I got skinny. A class mate told I looked very skinny and should start going to the gym. I considered it and realised it wasn’t a bad idea. A week later I got a gym membership as a christmas present and started hitting the gym hard. Sometimes twice a day because I had nothing to do. Gained 13kg the first year.
After high school I joined the military as a sub arctic ranger and got really hooked on long endurance races. Together with friends I’ve met their I’ve done multiple race such as Stockholm Marathon, Lidingöloppet, Vasaloppet and Vätterrundan.
Still feel I have much to improve and a big goal is to run marathon under 3 hours.
It will be done. Not sure when. Right now I’m focused on gaining strength while maintaining good running fitness.
