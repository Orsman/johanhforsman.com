    <h1>Hi,</h1>

    <p>My name is Johan Forsman and I’m a front-end-developer. Currently living in Stockholm Sweden.</p>

<p>I was on the path of becomming an economist. But realised there were so many things I wanted to do in life and being stuck in bank would not make me achieve those dreams. So I changed path. for years I traveled, played poker and cleared things on my TDBID-list.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, a close friend, introduced me to web development. I loved it and the freedom it gave me. I started coding on all my free time and later that year quit my part time jobs and started freelancing.</p>

<p>Today I’m working full time with developing useful pages and products on the internet. It’s amazing. I feel very privileged to be able to work with my hobby.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/contact.jpg" alt="Me" title="Me" /></p>

<p>I live my life very simple and value experiences much more than things and most of my time and money are invested in adventures. Everything I own can easily fit in a bigger backpack and now of those blue IKEA-bags. (winter in Sweden demands a lot of clothes).</p>
