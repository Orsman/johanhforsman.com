As I mentioned [here](/about "About me"), in 2009 I wrote down a list of everything I wanted to do in my life. Everything. Even though some of the items on that list felt far away, I realised that all of it could be achieved and experienced. The only thing that was between me and all those things was hard work and dedication.

Since then, this list have guided me in my life. If I don’t look at this list regularly I tend to just get caught up in the everyday grind. Weeks and months passes by and I haven’t come any closer to my dreams. A question i tend to ask myself very often is:

> “If these are the things I really want in my life, why shouldn’t I do everything I can to make it happen?“

That question drives me to put in all the hard work.

It’s important to emphasise that this isn’t about just ticking things of a list. It’s more of a guide and reminder of were I want to go in life. What I once wanted to do. And still do.

To me life is about experience moments and adventures. Not possession. And this whole bucket list thing for me can be summarised in; Being the best possible version of myself, experience life while I can, and live consciously.
