While I was writing my thesis on economics, I also wrote a list of things I wanted to to in my life. With no boundaries in mind I wrote down something that since that day have guided me, both career wise and in general. If the items on that list is stuff I really want to do and experience, why shouldn’t I do everything I can to achieve it? Why choose to do something else, that’s less fun?

That question have drove me to tick things of the list. And add more. You can argue that having a checklist is stupid and only makes you chase things. I see it a bit different. This is just a guide and a reminder of living my life on my own terms. Not getting to caught up in a daze where the days just passes by.
