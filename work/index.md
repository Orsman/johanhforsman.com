title:  "My experience"
---
<p>During summer of 2012 I was introduced to web development and saw the connection between becoming really good at front-end development and fulfilling my dream of building products. I started to learn everything about development, and spent all my free time studying and coding. Later that year I decided to quit my part time job and go full time freelancing. Big jump since I really didn’t have any reference cases. But I will not let fear of failing stop me from achieving what I want.</p>
<p>What drives me on a daily basis is that everything is on the internet and it’s all a chase of customers attention. And the product that wins is the one that has the stickiness-factor, is easy to use and fulfil a human need.</p>
<p>The last 2 years I’ve been involved in a tech startup here in Stockholm. When I started, there were no frontend built, which forced me to learn product development. During that time I had little to no experience of JavaScript and AngularJS development, but I was forced to learn. And over time I got better to the point where I’m now very comfortable in Javascript and especially AngularJS. Working in a team this small I’ve also gained experience in user testing, workflow management (git, gulp), sales and product development in general.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;margin-top:60px;">Tools 'n frameworks:</h3>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> is my preferred client-side MVC framework as it is highly extensible and good at working with dynamic data. When writing CSS, I prefer using pre-processors such as <a class="sass" href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>, due to their cleaner syntax and wider functionality. I also use <a class="gulp" href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">gulp</a> as my javascript task runner.</p>
