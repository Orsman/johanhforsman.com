My name is Johan Forsman and I’m a front-end-developer. Currently living in Stockholm Sweden.

I was on the path of becomming an economist. But realised there were so many things I wanted to do in life and being stuck in bank would not make me achieve those dreams. So I changed path. for years I traveled, played poker and cleared things on my TDBID-list.

A couple of years ago, a close friend, introduced me to web development. I loved it and the freedom it gave me. I started coding on all my free time and later that year quit my part time jobs and started freelancing.

Today I’m working full time with developing useful pages and products on the internet. It’s amazing. I feel very privileged to be able to work with my hobby.

I live my life very simple and value experiences much more than things and most of my time and money are invested in adventures. Everything I own can easily fit in a bigger backpack and now of those blue IKEA-bags. (winter in Sweden demands a lot of clothes).
